    1 - The problem that we were referencing had weird inputs, to address this we created
        our own inputs and put a spin on the probelm. Now, each terminal has its own load
        and unload schedule because each airport is different and runs on a different schedule. 

    2 - Another problem would be timeController (decrements the wait time) not updating before
        the threads progress through. This would cause all planes to have the maximum possible
        wait time for every terminal.

    3 - One challenge that we faced while implementing our project was calculating a total
        time taken. When a terminal is waiting, it still holds the possibility of reseting
        once it reaches zero and leaving the airport. This would mean that even though a
        node had a shorter distance, if its wait time had just reset we would need to calculate
        and choose another node.

    4 - Have to figure out a way to get a shared array between threads with no locks for
        both wait times as well as uploading travel times for flight plan
