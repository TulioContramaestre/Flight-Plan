Flight plan
    - All terminal locations with different travel times to get to each
        - Display in a 2D array?

Terminals
    - Each terminal has their own travel time to each other terminal but its directional so
      it is not the same going both ways
    - Each terminal runs on its own schedule, sending out planes at its own time
    - Not every terminal has flights going to every other terminal though all paths are possible
    - Planes leave the instant just before the wait timer resets (basically means 0)

multiThread class
    - All share some object to wait for updated wait times
    - Also share another shared object to know when to print out the flight plan
    - Takes an atomic integer for dijkstras algorithm
    - Inputs the shortest path array into the master fight plan matrix at its given level
    
TimeController
    - updates the designated wait time within a given time frame
    - Make sure all the threads operate within the timeBlock
    - Resets atomic integer
